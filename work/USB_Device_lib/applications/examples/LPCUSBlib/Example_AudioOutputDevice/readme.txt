== AudioOutputDevice example ==
==                           ==
===============================

This example implements an audio interface class device mode device that
enumerates as audio device (USB speakers) and sends the samples sent
to it from the host to the audio circuitry on the board.

The software that makes up this example is designed to run on many different
development boards. Therefore the compiler must be configured to build an image
that is targeted to the development board you are using. This section explains
how to set these build configurations for each of the supported compilers.

NOTE: read the Design notes section below if you are running this example
  on a part that supports high speed controllers.

  the word Ready.

To test the audio output click on this entry in the Sound dialog
  box. Then click on the Configure button to bring up the Speaker
  Setup dialog box. In this box press the Test button. Sound should
  be played through the left side of your headphones first, then

== Design notes ==
==              ==
==================

This example is designed to run only at full speed. The LPCUSBlib
  runs the USB controllers on the LPC18xx and LPC43xx parts at high
  speed by default. This default must be changed to run this example
  properly on these parts. To do this, change the value of the definition
  USB_FORCED_FULLSPEED in the file libraries/LPCUSBlib/LPCUSBlibConfig.h
  to 1

== AudioOutputHost example ==
==                         ==
=============================
This example implements an audio interface class host mode device that enumerates
an audio interface class device (USB speakers) and sends samples to the device.

The samples are created by a simple square wave generator in a timer ISR and
shipped out the streaming isochronous output pipe when a button is pressed on
the board.

This example can be built and debugged using two compiler tool chains.

how to setup and configure these tool chains to build this example.

The software that makes up this example is designed to run on many different
development boards. Therefore the compiler must be configured to build an image
that is targeted to the development board you are using. This section explains
how to set these build configurations for each of the supported compilers.

Audio Output Host Demo running.

When the USB speakers are plugged in the terminal window will display:
Audio Device Enumerated.

When the button is pressed on the board the USB speakers will produce
a loud tone. When the button is not pressed the USB speakers will be silent.

When the USB speakers are unplugged the terminal window will display:
Device Unattached.

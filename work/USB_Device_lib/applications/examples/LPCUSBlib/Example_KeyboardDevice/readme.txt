The example projects are designed to work with different NXP MCUs, development
boards, and IDEs.  This version of the KeyboardDevice example only works with
the LPCXpresso IDE, LPCXpresso development board with a LPC11U24(double check
that the device is a LPC11U24 which has the USB device drivers in ROM), and
an Embedded Artists LPCXpresso BaseBoard 
(http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/xpr_base.php).

  	Connect the type-B end of a USB cable to the mini receptacle on the
    	LPCXpresso board labeled J8 and the type-A end to the USB receptacle on a PC

2. LPCXpresso LPC11U14 plugged into the LPCXpresso base board Rev B
  	Plug the LPCXpresso LPC11U14 board into the connector labeled J4 on a
    	LPCXpresso base board Rev B 
  	Configure the base board according to the user's guide from Embedded Artists
  	Connect the mini type-B end of a USB cable to the receptacle on the base board
    	labeled X1 and the type-A end to the USB receptacle on a PC
  	Once the USB cable is connected to the board the following LEDs should be
    	illuminated:
      	LED25  (vbus)
     	LED26  (3.3v rail)
		
For both configurations the JTAG debugger is connected to the mini USB receptacle labeled J3 on the LPCXpresso LPC11U14 board

Running this example on the LPCXpresso LPC1769 can be done one of two ways:

1. LPCXpresso LPC1769 stand-alone. Solder a type-B USB receptacle onto the board
   and wire it up. See included schematics for details. Connect the type-B end
   of a USB cable to the receptacle on the LPCXpresso board and the type-A end
   to the USB receptacle on a PC

2. LPCXpresso LPC1769 plugged into the LPCXpresso base board Rev B. Plug the 
   LPCXpresso LPC1769 board into the connector labeled J4 on a LPCXpresso base
   board Rev B. Configure the base board according to the users guide from 
   Embedded Artists. Connect the mini type-B end of a USB cable to the
   receptacle on the base board labeled X1 and the type-A end to the USB
   receptacle on a PC.
   
   Once the USB cable is connected to the board the following LEDs should be
   illuminated:
      LED25  (vbus)
      LED26  (3.3v rail)
		
   For both configurations the JTAG debugger is connected to the mini USB
   receptacle labeled J3 on the LPCXpresso LPC1769 board.

When the example is run and the board is connected to a PC with a USB cable it
will enumerate on the PC as a HID Keyboard device. You should see the device 
appear in the "Device Manager" under "Keyboards". If you right click on HID
Keyboard Device->Properties a window will appear called "HID Keyboard Device
Properties". If you select the "Details" tab you will see a "Properties" drop
down, click on it and select "Hardware Ids". You should see the below entries
for Vendor Id and Product Id.

HID\VID_1FC9&PID_2042&REV_0001
HID\VID_1FC9&PID_2042


This information should match the data in the "Device Descriptor Structure"
in the "Descriptors.c" file in the Example_KeyboardDevice project directory.

To demostrate the keyboard open an editing application such as Notepad or
MS Word. Moving the joystick (SW2) on the Xpresso base board will output
characters onto the editing application.

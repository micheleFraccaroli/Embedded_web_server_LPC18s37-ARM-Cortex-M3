== KeyboardHost example ==
==                      ==
==========================
This example implements a HID class host mode device that enumerates a HID
class device with keyboard report descriptors and displays key press
characters on a terminal.
NOTE: many keyboards enumerate as a HUB device which is not supported by
  this example.

The software that makes up this example is designed to run on many different
development boards. Therefore the compiler must be configured to build an image
that is targeted to the development board you are using. This section explains
how to set these build configurations for each of the supported compilers.

Connect the JTAG debugger to the 20 pin JTAG or 10 pin Cortex Debug connector
Connect a 9 pin serial cable between COM0 on the board and a PC running
  a terminal program. Baud rate = 9600
To power the board:
  connect the type-B end of a powered USB cable to the type-B recepticle
  labeled 'Device'
  or
  Supply 5v to the -VIN+ pins between the JTAG and COM0 receptacles
Once the board is powered the following LEDs should be illuminated:

Running this example on the LPCXpresso LPC1769 can be done one of two ways:

1. LPCXpresso LPC1769 stand-alone
  Solder a type-B USB receptacle onto the board and wire it up. 
    See included schematics for details.
  Connect the type-B end of a USB cable to the receptacle on the
    LPCXpresso board and the type-A end to the USB receptacle on a PC

2. LPCXpresso LPC1769 plugged into the LPCXpresso base board Rev B
  Plug the LPCXpresso LPC1769 board into the connector labeled J4 on a
    LPCXpresso base board Rev B 
  Configure the base board according to the users guide from Embedded Artists
  Connect the mini type-B end of a USB cable to the receptacle on the base board
    labeled X1 and the type-A end to the USB receptacle on a PC
  Once the USB cable is connected to the board the following LEDs should be
    illuminated:
      LED25  (vbus)
      LED26  (3.3v rail)
		
For both configurations the JTAG debugger is connected to the mini USB
  receptacle labeled J3 on the LPCXpresso LPC1769 board

Use a PC running Windows XP, Vista or 7 to display runtime diagnostics
that can be viewed with a terminal emulation program like Teraterm or
Hyperterm. The baud rate in these programs should be set to 9600.

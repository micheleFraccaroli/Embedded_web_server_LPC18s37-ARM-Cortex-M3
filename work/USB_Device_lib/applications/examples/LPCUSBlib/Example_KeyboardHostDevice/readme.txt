==                             ==
=================================

This example implements a CDC/ACM (USB-to-COM) virtual serial device. The
example reads and writes data through a serial port on the chip which is
connected to either 9pin UART connector or a dedicated USB-to-COM chip
(FTDI) on the board.

The software that makes up this example is designed to run on many different
development boards. Therefore the compiler must be configured to build an image
that is targeted to the development board you are using. This section explains
how to set these build configurations for each of the supported compilers.

Running this example on the LPCXpresso LPC1769 can be done one of two ways:

1. LPCXpresso LPC1769 stand-alone. Solder a type-B USB receptacle onto the board
   and wire it up. See included schematics for details. Connect the type-B end
   of a USB cable to the receptacle on the LPCXpresso board and the type-A end
   to the USB receptacle on a PC

When the example is run and the board is connected to a PC with a USB cable a new
device called "Communication Port" will show up in the device manager under the
section "Ports (COM & LPT)"

Open a terminal emulation program and connected it to the COM port shown next to
this entry in the device manager. Open a second terminal emulation program connected
to the other UART connector (9 pin UART or USB-to-COM bridge) on the board. Type
characters in each terminal window and see them print on the other terminal window.
